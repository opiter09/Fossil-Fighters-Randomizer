# Fossil-Fighters-Randomizer
This is a digsite and starter randomizer for FF1.

Features:
- You can only dig up the main 100
- Vivos are matched 1-to-1, so nothing is impossible to get
- Your starter cannot be Spinax or water-type, nor in "broken" (see below)
- The three vivosaurs listed in "broken" in the Python code only appear post-game
  These are Lambeo, Guan, and T-Rex. All you need to do to change this is edit broken
  The values are their Numbers, of course
- You will never be able to dig up Tryma or the DP vivosaurs. This is because I cannot find
  where it says what they are, and I want to ensure all 100 vivosaurs can always be revived
- Teams are not edited, because there are a ton of team files, and my experience from doing
  that FFC challenge hack is that it takes *forever* to do anything with them

Also, you download this by pressing the green "Code" button and choosing "Download ZIP," and
you run it by dragging and dropping an FF1 ROM onto randomize.bat.
