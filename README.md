# Fossil-Fighters-Randomizer
This is a digsite, starter, and teams randomizer for FF1.

Features:
- This mod uses event-editing shenanigans to make it so you cannot go to the Trial Dig Site,
  and you can go to Greenhorn right away. As a result of this, however, if you try to back out
  of the digsite selection menu during Chapter 1, the game will freeze
- You can only dig up the main 100
- Vivos are matched 1-to-1, so nothing is impossible to get
- Your starter cannot be Spinax or water-type, nor someone from Post-Game Vivos (see below)
- The three vivosaurs listed in the box Post-Game Vivos, naturally, only appear post-game.
  These are Lambeo, Guan, and T-Rex. All you need to do to change this is edit the text input,
  making sure to use the vivosaurs' Numbers, and separating each by a comma and any number of
  spaces. Also, all entries after the 17th will be ignored
- You will never be able to dig up Tryma or the DP vivosaurs. This is because I cannot find
  where it says what they are, and I want to ensure all 100 vivosaurs can always be revived
- To make the Holt fight beatable, you can always find V-Raptor in the Keymonite room in the
  Digadigamid
- No text is altered. The thing saying you got a "Spinax dino medal" at the beginning should
  be the only oddity, but who knows
- Teams are not matched 1-to-1, for maximum chaos. They also edit only the vivosaur, not their
  levels or numbers of moves
- For that, use the "Team Level Change" box. This is additive, properly clamped to 1/12, and
  ignores any input that is not an integer (but negative ones are fine). Also the moves
  correspond to the levels properly (sorry Rex fans)
- Legendaries are not altered, nor can anything be turned into them
- If you randomize teams, your starter can be Water-type, because who cares then

Also, you download this by pressing the green "Code" button and choosing "Download ZIP," and
you run it by dragging and dropping an FF1 ROM onto randomize.exe. You MUST put the ROM in
the same folder as the exe, or it won't work.
